<li> It is a lack of empathy, not necessarily intentional but may very well be, that causes people to place their parents and elders in living conditions which drain their souls. Nursing homes are like prisons, not only in their relationship to their inhabitants but in their design as well(keeping the miscreants of society away from "normal people or keeping the elderly/incapacitated away from those who are "free").</li>
