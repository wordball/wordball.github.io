        <h1> Questions I Want Answers To </h1>

        <p> Over the course of my life, I intend on using this page to document questions that I come up with. If you have any answers to these, feel free to let me know :) </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Why is it considered <a href = "https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2022/08/423446/reprogramming-brains-cleaning-crew-mop-alzheimers-disease">difficult</a> to tamper with the genetic machinery of glial cells?</li>
            <li> Every single metaphysical question you can think of</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> I've also included a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lX0VdITHeaR5jY57bv93GGixq6XCbQ5NVXUNBxEkNP4/edit#gid=823990558"> spreadsheet </a> of things I want to learn and literature I want to eventually read. Each person's intellectual interests and curiosities are a deeply personal thing and for me, it's no different; however, maybe someone out there might find one of these resources to be interesting or relevant to their circumstances or future goals. </p>
